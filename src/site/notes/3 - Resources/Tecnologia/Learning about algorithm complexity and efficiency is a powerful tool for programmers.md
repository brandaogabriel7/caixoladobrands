## The idea
[[3 - Resources/Tecnologia/Learning about algorithm complexity and efficiency is a powerful tool for programmers\|Learning about algorithm complexity and efficiency is a powerful tool for programmers]]
A programmer that knows how to evaluate algorithm complexity and efficiency is highly equipped to solve complex problems in the best way possible.

By understanding how each algorithm performs for each scenario, a person can make better choices when designing software solutions and choose the algorithm that will best address the issue.
