- Normalization is about reducing redundancy and increasing data integrity in databases. That is done by organizing data into multiple related tables, which is ideal for OLTP systems.
- Denormalization, on the other hand, is about introducing controlled redundancy by merging tables. That improves read performance, which is ideal for OLAP systems
